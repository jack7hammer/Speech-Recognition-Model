# Speech recognition
Speech recognition is a interdisciplinary subfield of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers. It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech to text (STT).

# Speech in terms of computer science?
Speech is nothing but audio waves and audio waves can be digitalized using sampling. We work with these samples to build a model that can recognize speech.
